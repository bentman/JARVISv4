- Role‑separated, disciplined, and built for long‑term growth.

## Description
A Local-First AI Assistant based on **Explicit Cognition Framework (ECF)**, a local-first architecture striving to solve agentic drift, context taint, and halucination. By demoting the LLM to a **stateless reasoning component** and enforcing **deterministic control** via a specialized Controller, JARVISv4 ensures reliability. All state is maintained in **externalized memory artifacts** (Working, Episodic, Semantic), and improvement is driven by **explicit weight learning** rather than context accumulation.

See [Project.md](Project.md) for the authoritative architecture and vision.
