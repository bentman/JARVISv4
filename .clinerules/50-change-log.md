# 50-change-log.md

`CHANGE_LOG.md` rules:
- Append-only history of completed, validated work.
- Write an entry only after the mini-phase objective is “done” and supported by evidence.
- No edits/reorders/deletes of past entries. If an entry is wrong, append a corrective entry.
- Each entry must include:
  - Timestamp: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
  - Summary: 1–2 lines, past tense
  - Scope: files/areas touched
  - Evidence: exact command(s) run + a minimal excerpt pointer (or embedded excerpt ≤10 lines)
- If a change is reverted, append a new entry describing the revert and why.

When to write:
- Only after the objective is validated “done” with evidence.
- If work stops at proposal-only or fails validation, do not add a change-log entry.
