# 30-doc-truth.md

Authority and ordering:
- `AGENTS.md` is the contract (if present).
- `Project.md` is the vision/intent.
- `SYSTEM_INVENTORY.md` is a snapshot and may lag.
- `CHANGE_LOG.md` is append-only history.

Rules:
- Don’t update docs based on intent. Update only after validation evidence supports the claim.
- Don’t restate docs. Quote only minimal lines needed to justify a decision.
- If a doc conflicts with observed repo truth, report the conflict and propose the smallest correction.
